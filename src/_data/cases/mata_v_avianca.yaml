factual_foundation:
  factual_summary: |
    Roberto Mata commenced proceedings against Avianca, Inc on 2 February 2022, alleging personal injury sustained when a metal serving cart struck his left knee during a flight from El Salvador to John F Kennedy Airport. The matter was removed to federal court under the Montreal Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air. Steven Schwartz and Peter LoDuca of the Levidow Firm represented the plaintiff. On 13 January 2023, Avianca filed a motion to dismiss arguing the claims were time-barred. The defendants filed an opposition containing citations to eight judicial decisions that were subsequently revealed to be fabricated by ChatGPT. When challenged by opposing counsel and court orders, the attorneys continued to defend the authenticity of the fake cases through multiple submissions, ultimately resulting in Rule 11 sanctions proceedings and a landmark decision on professional responsibility in the age of artificial intelligence.
